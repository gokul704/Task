This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

In This project I used the Apis of FakestoreApi website which has login and I created the neccessary models for the data accoriding to the api response and stored the access token in the shared preference and i used the providers statemanagement to maintain  the items in the cart. I used the shared preferences to get the persistance of cart even when the app is closeed the percistance data from the shared  preferences will maintain the cart data even when the app is closed and opened again
